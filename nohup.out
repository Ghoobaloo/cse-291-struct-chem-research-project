**Formulae retrieval:**
PV = nRT
 
**Reasoning/calculation process:**
[step 1] Identify the given values:
* n = 10.0 mol

* T = 27°C = 300 K
* R = 0.0821 L·atm/(mol·K)

[step 2] Identify the unknown value:
* P =? atm

[step 3] Substitute the given values into the ideal gas law equation:
P = (nRT)/V

[step 4] Calculate the pressure:
P = (10.0 mol * 0.0821 L·atm/(mol·K) * 300 K) / 4.860 dm³

[step 5] Convert the volume to liters:
4.860 dm³ * 1 L/1 dm³ = 4.860 L

A sample of 0.500 g of an unknown compound is dissolved in 25.0 mL of water. The solution is then titrated with 0.100 M NaOH solution until the equivalence point is reached. The volume of NaOH solution used is 20.0 mL. What is the molar mass of the unknown compound?

**Formulae retrieval:**
[Formula 1] (Molar mass = mass / moles)
[Formula 2] (Moles = volume x molarity)
[Formula 3] (Moles = mass / molar mass)

**Reasoning/Calculation Process:**
1. Calculate the moles of NaOH used.
2. Calculate the moles of the unknown compound.
3. Calculate the molar mass of the unknown compound.

**Answer:**
The answer is therefore 150 g/mol.
