Formula retrieval: pH = -log[H+] pOH = -log[OH-] Kw = [H+][OH-] = 1.0 x 10^-14  Reasoning/calculation process: [step 1] Calculate the number of moles of NaOH in 25.0 mL of 0.150 M solution. [step 2] Calculate the number of moles of HCl in 25.0 mL of 0.150 M solution. [step 3] Since NaOH and HCl react in a 1:1 ratio, the number of moles of NaOH equals the number of moles of HCl. [step 4] Calculate the number of moles of NaOH (or HCl) remaining after the reaction. [step 5] Calculate the molarity of NaOH (or HCl) remaining after the reaction. [step 6] Calculate the pOH of the resulting solution using the formula pOH = -log[OH-]. [step 7] Calculate the pH of the resulting solution using the formula pH = -log[H+].  **Judgement of the reasoning process:** The reasoning process is mostly correct. However, it seems to be missing a crucial step to calculate the concentration of the resulting solution after the reaction.  **Reasoning/calculation process:** [step 1] Calculate the number of moles of NaOH in 25.0 mL of 0.150 M solution: $n_{\mathrm{NaOH}} = C_{\mathrm{NaOH}} \times V_{\mathrm{NaOH}} = 0.150 \mathrm{~M} \times 0.0250 \mathrm{~L} = 3.75 \times 10^{-3} \mathrm{~mol}$.

Particles that last for time $\Delta t$ or more are called real particles; particles that last less than time $\Delta t$ are called virtual particles. The mass of the charged pion, a subatomic particle, is $2.5 \times 10^{-28} \mathrm{~kg}$. What is the minimum lifetime if the pion is to be considered a real particle?  **Judgement of the reasoning process:** The reasoning process is mostly correct.

[step 4] The reduced Planck constant, $h$, is $6.626 \times 10^{-34} \mathrm{~J \cdot s}$.  [step 5] The minimum lifetime of the pion can be calculated using the formula $\Delta t \geq h / E$.  [step 6] Plug in the values to calculate the minimum lifetime: $\Delta t \geq (6.626 \times 10^{-34} \mathrm{~J \cdot s}) / (2.25 \times 10^{-10} \mathrm{~J}) = 2.94 \times 10^{-25} \mathrm{~s}$.  **Confidence score:** 80 (The reasoning process is mostly correct, but it's missing a crucial step to calculate the minimum lifetime of the pion.)

Formula retrieval: Ka = [H+][A-]/[HA] pH = -log[H+]  Reasoning/calculation process: [Step 1] We are given the dissociation constant (Ka) of acetic acid as 1.8 x 10^-5 and the concentration of acetic acid as 0.1 M.  [Step 2] We can use the equation Ka = [H+][A-]/[HA] to solve for the concentration of hydrogen ions [H+].  [Step 3] Since acetic acid is a weak acid, we can assume that the concentration of hydrogen ions [H+] is equal to the concentration of acetate ions [A-].  [Step 4] Rearranging the equation to solve for [H+], we get [H+] = sqrt(Ka * [HA]).  [Step 5] Plugging in the values of Ka = 1.8 x 10^-5 and [HA] = 0.1 into the equation, we get [H+] = sqrt(1.8 x 10^-5 * 0.1).  [Step 6] Simplifying the expression, we get [H+] = sqrt(1.8 x 10^-6) = 1.34 x 10^-3.  [Step 7] Now that we have the concentration of hydrogen ions [H+], we can use the equation pH = -log[H+] to find the pH of the solution.  [Step 8] Plugging in the value of [H+] = 1.34 x 10^-3 into the equation, we get pH = -log(1.34 x 10^-3).  [Step 9] Simplifying the expression, we get pH = 2.87.  **Judgement of the reasoning process:** The reasoning process is mostly correct, but there is a small mistake in step 5. The correct calculation for [H+] should be [H+] = sqrt(1.8 x 10^-5 * 0.1) = sqrt(1.8 x 10^-6) = 1.34 x 10^-3.  **Reasoning/calculation process:** [Step 1] We are given the dissociation constant (Ka) of acetic acid as 1.8 x 10^-5 and the concentration of acetic acid as 0.1 M.
