Conclude the answer by stating ""The answer is therefore \boxed{[ANSWER]}.  For each instance, you need to three things. Firstly, for ""formulae retrieval"", you need to identify the formulae explicitly and implicitly entailed in the problem context. Then there is a ""reasoning/calculation process"" where you are required to reason step by step based on the identified formulae and problem context. Answer the question by implementing a solver function ""def solver():"" in Python. Finally, conclude the answer.
