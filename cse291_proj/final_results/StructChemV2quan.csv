Formula retrieval: Ka = [H+][CH3COO-]/[CH3COOH] pH = -log[H+]  Reasoning/calculation process: [Step 1] The dissociation constant (Ka) of acetic acid is given as 1.8 x 10^-5.  [Step 2] We are given a 0.1 M solution of acetic acid, which means the initial concentration of acetic acid is 0.1 M.  [Step 3] Let's denote the concentration of hydrogen ions (H+) as [H+] and the concentration of acetate ions (CH3COO-) as [CH3COO-]. Since acetic acid is a weak acid, we can assume that the concentration of hydrogen ions is equal to the concentration of acetate ions, i.e., [H+] = [CH3COO-].  [Step 4] We can use the dissociation constant (Ka) to relate the concentrations of hydrogen ions, acetate ions, and acetic acid:  Ka = [H+][CH3COO-]/[CH3COOH]  [Step 5] Since [H+] = [CH3COO-], we can substitute this into the equation:  Ka = [H+]^2/[CH3COOH]  [Step 6] Rearranging the equation to solve for [H+], we get:  [H+] = sqrt(Ka * [CH3COOH])  [Step 7] Substituting the values of Ka and [CH3COOH], we get:  [H+] = sqrt(1.8 x 10^-5 * 0.1)  [Step 8] Evaluating the expression, we get:  [H+] = sqrt(1.8 x 10^-6)  [Step 9] Taking the square root, we get:  [H+] = 1.34 x 10^-3  [Step 10] Finally, we can use the pH formula to find the pH of the solution:  pH = -log[H+]  [Step 11] Substituting the value of [H+], we get:  pH = -log(1.34 x 10^-3)  [Step 12] Evaluating the expression, we get:  pH = 2.87  **Judgement of the retrieved formulae:** The retrieved formulae seem to be correct and relevant to the problem.  **Reasoning/calculation process:** [Step 1] The dissociation constant (Ka) of acetic acid is given as 1.8 x 10^-5.

"2.13","What is the pH of a 0.1 M solution of a weak acid HA that is 5% dissociated?  Formula retrieval: Ka = [H+][A-]/[HA] pH = -log[H+]  Reasoning/calculation process: [Step 1] First, we need to find the concentration of H+ ions in the solution. Since the acid is 5% dissociated, the concentration of H+ ions will be 5% of the initial concentration of the acid.  [Step 2] The initial concentration of the acid is 0.1 M, so the concentration of H+ ions will be 0.05 M.  [Step 3] Next, we can use the formula pH = -log[H+] to find the pH of the solution.  [Step 4] Plugging in the value of [H+] = 0.05 M, we get pH = -log(0.05).  [Step 5] Simplifying, we get pH = -(-1.3) = 1.3.  **Judgement of the retrieved formulae:** The retrieved formulae seem to be correct.
