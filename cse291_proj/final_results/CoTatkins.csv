Unless otherwise stated, thermodynamic data are for 298.15 K. Calculate the standard enthalpy of solution of $\mathrm{AgCl}(\mathrm{s})$ in water from the enthalpies of formation of the solid and the aqueous ions.assistant  **Formulae retrieval:**  ΔH°soln = ΔH°f(aq) - ΔH°f(s) ΔH°f(aq) = ΔH°f(Ag+) + ΔH°f(Cl-) ΔH°f(Ag+) = 105.58 kJ/mol ΔH°f(Cl-) = -167.16 kJ/mol ΔH°f(AgCl(s)) = -127.01 kJ/mol  **Reasoning/calculation process:**  [Step 1]: First, we need to calculate the enthalpy of formation of the aqueous ions Ag+ and Cl- using their respective standard enthalpies of formation. Since the enthalpy of formation of AgCl(s) can be expressed as the sum of the enthalpies of formation of its constituent ions: ΔH°f(AgCl(s)) = ΔH°f(Ag+) + ΔH°f(Cl-)  Rearrange the equation to find the enthalpy of formation of the aqueous ions: ΔH°f(Ag+) = ΔH°f(AgCl(s)) - ΔH°f(Cl-) = -127.01 kJ/mol - (-167.16 kJ/mol) = 40.15 kJ/mol  Now that we have the enthalpy of formation of Ag+, let's proceed with finding the enthalpy of formation of the aqueous chloride ion.  However, the above approach doesn't apply here because it was a misunderstanding of how to use given information.   To correctly solve this problem, we should use the general relationship between the standard enthalpy of formation of a compound and its ions in the solution state. Therefore, we will use the relation between the standard enthalpy of formation of the compound (in this case, the salt), and the enthalpy of formation of its constituent ions in aqueous solution.  [Step 2]: Since we know that the standard enthalpy of formation of AgCl(s) equals the sum of the standard enthalpies of formation of Ag+(aq) and Cl-(aq): ΔH°f(AgCl(s)) = ΔH°f(Ag+(aq)) + ΔH°f(Cl-(aq))  We also know the values for ΔH°f(AgCl(s)) and ΔH°f(Cl-). We now rearrange the equation to solve for ΔH°f(Ag+(aq)): ΔH°f(Ag+(aq)) = ΔH°f(AgCl(s)) - ΔH°f(Cl-) = -127.01 kJ/mol - (-167.16 kJ/mol) = 40.15 kJ/mol  Now that we have calculated the enthalpy of formation of Ag+(aq), let's find the enthalpy of solution (ΔH°soln).  [Step 3]: To determine the enthalpy of solution of AgCl(s) in water, we can subtract the enthalpy of formation of the solid from the sum of the enthalpies of formation of the ions in the solution state: ΔH°soln = ΔH°f(Ag+(aq)) + ΔH°f(Cl-(aq)) - ΔH°f(AgCl(s)) = 40.15 kJ/mol + (-167.16 kJ/mol) - (-127.01 kJ/mol) = -0.00 kJ/mol  **Answer conclusion:**  The answer is therefore \boxed{-0.000}."

A sample consisting of $3.00 \mathrm{~mol}$ of diatomic perfect gas molecules at $200 \mathrm{~K}$ is compressed reversibly and adiabatically until its temperature reaches $250 \mathrm{~K}$. Given that $C_{V, \mathrm{~m}}=27.5 \mathrm{~J} \mathrm{~K}^{-1} \mathrm{~mol}^{-1}$, calculate $q$.assistant  **Formulae retrieval:**  \[ C_V = \frac{\Delta U}{\Delta T} \] \[ q = nC_V\Delta T \]  **Reasoning/calculation process:**  [step 1] To determine \( q \), we must find \( \Delta U \) using the equation \( C_V = \frac{\Delta U}{\Delta T} \). We can rearrange it to get \( \Delta U = C_V \cdot \Delta T \).  [step 2] Since the process is adiabatic and reversible, the change in internal energy \( \Delta U \) equals zero because for an ideal gas undergoing an adiabatic reversible process, the work done does not result in a change in internal energy. However, since the gas has expanded or contracted, the potential and kinetic energies would remain constant but there could be an increase or decrease in heat content depending upon whether the expansion was exothermic or endothermic. In this case, the question asks for heat content so let's proceed further.   However, in order to proceed further, we also need to consider another important aspect of the given problem which involves calculating the amount of work done by the system during the adiabatic expansion. The work done during an adiabatic process is calculated by the formula:  \[ W = \frac{nR\Delta T_1^a\Delta T_2^{a-1}}{(T_2-T_1)} \]  where, \( \Delta T_1^a=\left(\frac{T_1}{T_2}\right)^{\frac{a-1}{a}} - 1\)  Here 'a' represents the ratio of specific heats Cp/Cv which is equal to 7/5 = 1.4 for diatomic molecules.  Now let us find out the value of a, we know that for a diatomic gas, \(Cp = 29.87 \mathrm{~J} \mathrm{~K}^{-1} \mathrm{~mol}^{-1}\) so we can easily calculate 'a' from the relation \(a=\frac{C_p}{C_v}\).   [step 3] Now let's calculate 'a', \( a = \frac{C_p}{C_v} = \frac{29.87}{27.5} \approx 1.089 \)   [step 4] Next, we can use the formula to calculate the change in temperature of the first kind, \( \Delta T_1^a \):  \[ \Delta T_1^a = \left( \frac{T_1}{T_2} \right)^{\frac{a-1}{a}} - 1 \] \[ \Delta T_1^a = \left( \frac{200}{250} \right)^{\frac{0.089}{1.089}} - 1 \] \[ \Delta T_1^a \approx 0.00978 \]   [step 5] After finding the values of 'a' and ΔT1^a, now we have all necessary values to find the work done by the system during the adiabatic expansion:   \[ W = \frac{nR\Delta T_1^a\Delta T_2^{a-1}}{(T_2-T_1)} \] \[ W = \frac{3.00 \times 8.314 \times 0.00978 \times (250 - 200)^{1.089 - 1}}{(250-200)} \] \[ W \approx -9.18 \, \mathrm{J} \] Since work done by the system is negative, the system loses energy to the surroundings   [step 6] Now we know that the total change in internal energy is the sum of change in kinetic energy and potential energy. Since the gas expands, some of its energy turns into kinetic energy of the moving particles. Thus, the change in potential energy remains negligible. Therefore, the change in internal energy of the gas is zero.   However, considering the fact that the system has lost energy during the process due to the work being done, the energy gained from the surroundings can be found out by considering the negative of the work done by the system. \[ \Delta U = 0 \implies q + w = 0 \] Therefore, \[ q = -W \] \[ q = -(-9.18) \] \[ q = 9.18 \, \mathrm{J} \]   **Answer conclusion:** The answer is therefore \boxed{9.180}."

Unless otherwise stated, thermodynamic data are for 298.15 K. For the reaction $\mathrm{C}_2 \mathrm{H}_5 \mathrm{OH}(\mathrm{l})+3 \mathrm{O}_2(\mathrm{~g}) \rightarrow 2 \mathrm{CO}_2(\mathrm{~g})+3 \mathrm{H}_2 \mathrm{O}(\mathrm{g})$, $\Delta_{\mathrm{r}} U^\ominus=-1373 \mathrm{~kJ} \mathrm{~mol}^{-1}$ at $298 \mathrm{~K}$, calculate $\Delta_{\mathrm{r}} H^{\ominus}$.assistant  **Formulae retrieval:**  $\Delta_{\mathrm{r}} U^\ominus=\Delta_{\mathrm{r}} H^\ominus-\Delta n R T$ where $\Delta n$ is the change in the number of moles of gas molecules during the reaction, and $R$ is the ideal gas constant.  $\Delta n=n(\text { products })-n(\text { reactants })$  **Reasoning/calculation process:**  [Step 1]: First, we need to determine the value of $\Delta n$ for the given reaction. From the equation $\Delta n=n(\text { products })-n(\text { reactants })$, we can see that the reaction produces $2$ moles of carbon dioxide ($\mathrm{CO}_2$) and $3$ moles of water vapor ($\mathrm{H}_2 \mathrm{O}$), while it consumes $3$ moles of oxygen ($\mathrm{O}_2$). Therefore, the total number of moles of gaseous product species is $2 + 3 = 5$ moles, and the total number of moles of gaseous reactant species is $3$ moles. Thus, we have: $\Delta n=5-3=2$  [Step 2]: Next, we use the formula $\Delta_{\mathrm{r}} U^\ominus=\Delta_{\mathrm{r}} H^\ominus-\Delta n R T$ to find the relationship between $\Delta_{\mathrm{r}} U^\ominus$ and $\Delta_{\mathrm{r}} H^\ominus$. Rearranging the formula to isolate $\Delta_{\mathrm{r}} H^\ominus$, we get: $\Delta_{\mathrm{r}} H^\ominus=\Delta_{\mathrm{r}} U^\ominus+\Delta n R T$  [Step 3]: We know the values of $\Delta_{\mathrm{r}} U^\ominus$ and $T$. Plugging them into the equation above along with the calculated value of $\Delta n$, we can obtain $\Delta_{\mathrm{r}} H^\ominus$: $\Delta_{\mathrm{r}} H^\ominus=-1373 \mathrm{~kJ} \mathrm{~mol}^{-1}+(2)(8.3145 \mathrm{~J} \mathrm{~K}^{-1} \mathrm{~mol}^{-1})(298 \mathrm{~K})$  [Step 4]: Now, convert joule to kilojoule by dividing by 1000 to match units: $\Delta_{\mathrm{r}} H^\ominus=-1373 \mathrm{~kJ} \mathrm{~mol}^{-1}+(2)(8.3145 \times 10^{-3} \mathrm{~kJ} \mathrm{~K}^{-1} \mathrm{~mol}^{-1})(298 \mathrm{~K})$  [Step 5]: Calculate the numerical result of the expression: $\Delta_{\mathrm{r}} H^\ominus=-1373 \mathrm{~kJ} \mathrm{~mol}^{-1}+4.96 \mathrm{~kJ} \mathrm{~mol}^{-1}$  [Step 6]: Simplify the expression to obtain the final answer: $\Delta_{\mathrm{r}} H^\ominus=-1368.04 \mathrm{~kJ} \mathrm{~mol}^{-1}$  **Answer conclusion:**  The answer is therefore $\boxed{-1368.044}$."

Predict the pressure exerted by the ethane from the perfect gas.assistant  **Formulae retrieval:**  The ideal gas law formula: PV = nRT Molar volume of an ideal gas: V_m = RT / P   **Reasoning/calculation process:**  [Step 1]: First, we need to find the molar mass of C_2 H_6. The atomic masses of carbon and hydrogen are approximately 12 g/mol and 1 g/mol respectively. Therefore,  molar mass of C_2 H_6 = (2 * 12) + 6 * 1 = 30 g/mol  [Step 2]: Convert the given volume from dm^3 to L (since R is typically expressed in units of L atm/(mol K)). There are 1 dm^3 in 1 L.

Calculate the work that would be done if the same expansion occurred reversibly.assistant  **Formulae retrieval:** pV = nRT  W = nRT ln(Vf/Vi) (work done during reversible isothermal expansion) n = m/M (number of moles, given mass and molar mass of gas)  **Reasoning/calculation process:**  [step 1] First, we need to find the number of moles of methane present using its molar mass. The molar mass of methane (CH4) is approximately 16 g/mol.  [step 2] Use the ideal gas law equation pV = nRT to rearrange it to isolate n (number of moles), then plug in the values we know: n = pV / RT. Since we're looking for n, we'll use the initial conditions (Vi and Ti). However, we still need to calculate the pressure at these conditions.  [step 3] Rearrange the ideal gas equation to solve for pressure: p = nRT / V. We don't have the value of pressure directly but can calculate it using the information from step 1 and 2.  [step 4] To determine the pressure at the initial condition, we'll first calculate the number of moles of methane: n = m / M = 4.5 g / 0.016 kg/mol = 281.25 mol.  [step 5] Now we can calculate the initial pressure using the ideal gas equation: p_i = n * R * T_i / V_i = (281.25 mol * 8.314 J/(mol*K) * 283 K) / 0.0127 m^3 = 6.49 * 10^5 Pa  [step 6] Plug the calculated number of moles into the equation for work done during reversible expansion: W = nR*T*ln(Vf/Vi).  [step 7] Substitute the known values into the equation: W = (281.25 mol * 8.314 J/(mol*K) * 283 K * ln(1/0.0127)) = - 5.65 * 10^6 J  However, since the question asks for the work done if the same expansion occurred reversibly, we take the absolute value.

Unless otherwise stated, thermodynamic data are for 298.15 K. A strip of magnesium of mass $15 \mathrm{~g}$ is placed in a beaker of dilute hydrochloric acid. Calculate the work done by the system as a result of the reaction. The atmospheric pressure is 1.0 atm and the temperature $25^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$.assistant  **Formulae retrieval:**  $\Delta G = \Delta H - T\Delta S$ $w = -\Delta G$ $pV = nRT$  **Reasoning/calculation process:**  Firstly, we need to write down the chemical equation for the reaction between magnesium and hydrochloric acid: Mg (s) + 2HCl(aq) → MgCl2(aq) + H2(g) From the balanced chemical equation, it can be observed that one mole of hydrogen gas is produced per mole of magnesium reacted.  We know that $\Delta G = \Delta H - T\Delta S$, but since we're interested in calculating the work done by the system, we'll use the relation $w = -\Delta G$.   To calculate $\Delta G$, we also need to consider the standard Gibbs free energy change ($\Delta G^\circ$). However, since no specific information about the standard conditions for this reaction is provided, we assume that the given conditions (atmospheric pressure of 1.0 atm and temperature of 25°C) closely approximate the standard state conditions.  Next, let's determine the entropy change associated with the formation of one mole of hydrogen gas at 298.15 K. This involves using the formula for entropy of an ideal gas, but since the problem doesn't directly involve calculating entropy change for the reaction, we can instead utilize the relation pV=nRT to find the volume of the gas produced. As we don't have values for n, we must calculate it from the known amount of magnesium reacted.  The molar mass of magnesium is approximately 24 g/mol. Therefore, the number of moles of magnesium reacted can be calculated as follows: n = mass of magnesium / molar mass of magnesium = 15 g / 24 g/mol ≈ 0.625 mol  Since the reaction produces one mole of hydrogen gas for every mole of magnesium reacted, n (hydrogen gas) ≈ 0.625 mol  Using the ideal gas law to calculate the volume of the gas at STP (standard temperature and pressure), we get: pV = nRT Rearranging the equation to isolate V, we obtain: V = nRT/p  Substituting the given values and R = 0.082 L atm/(mol K): V = (0.625 mol * 0.082 L atm/(mol K) * 298.15 K) / 1.0 atm V ≈ 14.76 L  Now that we know the volume of the gas, we can proceed to calculate the work done by the system. We know that w = -ΔG, but ΔG is related to ΔH and ΔS through the equation ΔG = ΔH - TΔS. Since we don't have direct access to these values, we cannot compute ΔG without additional assumptions.  However, considering the fact that we have been asked to calculate the work done due to the expansion of the gas only, we can make use of the expression for work done by an expanding gas, W = ∫pdV. But given the information available, we can simplify our calculation by relating the work done to the product of pressure and the change in volume (ΔV). Assuming an average pressure (which would be the initial pressure in this case), we can estimate the work done using the equation w = PΔV.  Therefore,  w = P * ΔV where ΔV is the volume change of the system. Given that the volume of the gas has increased by 14.76 L during the reaction, ΔV = V_f - V_i Since we started from a solid state, the initial volume (Vi) was zero. Hence, ΔV = V_f = 14.76 L Now substituting the given value of pressure (P = 1 atm), w = 1 atm * 14.76 L w ≈ 14.76 L atm  Finally, we convert the units of work into joules by multiplying by 101.325 J/L atm: w ≈ 14.76 L atm * 101.325 J/L atm w ≈ 1498.55 J  **Answer conclusion:** The answer is therefore \boxed{1498.553}."

Calculate the change in chemical potential of a perfect gas when its pressure is increased isothermally from $1.8 \mathrm{~atm}$ to $29.5 \mathrm{~atm}$ at $40^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$.assistant  **Formulae retrieval:** $\Delta\mu = RT \ln \left( \frac{P_2}{P_1} \right)$  **Reasoning/calculation process:**  [step 1] We know that the change in chemical potential ($\Delta\mu$) can be calculated using the formula $\Delta\mu = RT \ln \left( \frac{P_2}{P_1} \right)$, where R is the ideal gas constant, T is the temperature in Kelvin, P1 and P2 are the initial and final pressures respectively.  [step 2] First, we need to convert the given temperatures to Kelvin. Given that the temperature is $40^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$, we have $T = 40 + 273.15 = 313.15 \mathrm{~K}$.  [step 3] Now we substitute the values of P1 and P2 into the equation, where P1 = 1.8 atm and P2 = 29.5 atm.  [step 4] Substituting these values along with the value of T and R into the equation gives us: $\Delta\mu = (8.3145 \mathrm{~J/mol*K}) (313.15 \mathrm{~K}) \ln \left( \frac{29.5 \mathrm{~atm}}{1.8 \mathrm{~atm}} \right)$  [step 5] Evaluating the expression inside the logarithm first, we get  $\frac{29.5}{1.8} = 16.3889$  [step 6] Next, calculate the natural logarithm of the ratio of the two pressures: $\ln (16.3889) = 2.823$  [step 7] Now, multiply the result of the previous step with the product of the gas constant (R) and the temperature (T): $(8.3145)(313.15)(2.823) = 7090.49$  [step 8] Therefore, the change in chemical potential is equal to 7090.49 J/mol.  **Answer conclusion:** The answer is therefore $\boxed{7090.490}.$"

Note that 1 atm = 1.013 25 bar. Unless otherwise stated, thermochemical data are for 298.15 K. A sample consisting of $2.0 \mathrm{~mol} \mathrm{CO}_2$ occupies a fixed volume of $15.0 \mathrm{dm}^3$ at $300 \mathrm{~K}$. When it is supplied with $2.35 \mathrm{~kJ}$ of energy as heat its temperature increases to $341 \mathrm{~K}$. Assume that $\mathrm{CO}_2$ is described by the van der Waals equation of state, and calculate $w$.assistant  **Formulae retrieval:** PV = nRT (Ideal Gas Law)  P + \frac{n^2a}{V^2}(1 - \frac{4b}{RT}) = \frac{nRT}{V-b} - \frac{an^2}{V^2} (van der Waals Equation of State) Q = mc\Delta T (Heat transfer) W = Q - E (First law of thermodynamics)  **Reasoning/calculation process:**  To find W, we must first determine the work done using the van der Waals equation of state. However, we can use the ideal gas law to check the change in internal energy, since the temperature change is small.  We know that the initial temperature is $T_1 = 300 \mathrm{~K}$, the final temperature is $T_2 = 341 \mathrm{~K}$, the initial volume is $V_1 = 15.0 \mathrm{~L}$, the number of moles is $n = 2.0$, R = 8.3145 J/mol*K, and Q = $2.35 \times 10^3$ J.  First, let's check if the temperature change is indeed small enough to neglect the change in internal energy: ΔU = nCvΔT Since CO2 has five degrees of freedom (three translational and two rotational), Cv = (5/2)R = 12.965 J/mol*K. ΔU ≈ 2.0 * 12.965 * (341 - 300) = 463.54 J This is relatively small compared to the heat added, so we can assume ΔU ≈ 0 and use the first law of thermodynamics to calculate W.  W = Q - ΔU ≈ Q = $2.35 \times 10^3$ J   However, to accurately solve the problem, we need to consider the change in volume due to the change in temperature and pressure. We'll have to rearrange the ideal gas law to isolate V: V = \frac{nRT}{P} Then differentiate both sides with respect to T: dV = \frac{nR}{P}dT Now integrate both sides from T1 to T2: \int_{V_1}^{V_2} dV = \frac{nR}{P}\int_{T_1}^{T_2} dT Since P is constant, we can take it outside the integral: V_2-V_1=\frac{nR(T_2-T_1)}{P}  We still don't have enough information about P, but we can try to express P using the van der Waals equation of state: P = \frac{nRT}{V-b}-\frac{n^2a}{V^2} Since we're working under conditions where the correction terms are negligible, we can approximate this expression to P ≈ \frac{nRT}{V}. Substituting this into our previous equation gives us: V_2-V_1=\frac{nR(T_2-T_1)}{\frac{nRT_2}{V_2}-b}  We also need to find the value of b for CO2. From the given options, I am unable to locate the van der Waals constant 'b' for CO2. However, using critical constants for carbon dioxide, b = 4.28 L/mol.  Using V1 = 15.0 L, T1 = 300 K, T2 = 341 K, n = 2.0 mol, R = 8.3145 J/(mol*K) and b = 4.28 L/mol: V_2-V_1=\frac{2.0*8.3145(341-300)}{\frac{2.0*8.3145*341}{V_2}-4.28}  Solving for V2 yields V2 = 16.03 L.  Now, we can substitute back into our approximation of P to get P = \frac{nRT}{V} = \frac{2.0*8.3145*341}{16.03} = 87.39 Pa  Now that we have the values for P, V1, T1, and T2, we can plug them into our original expression for the change in volume: V_2-V_1=\frac{nR(T_2-T_1)}{P}=\frac{2.0*8.3145*(341-300)}{87.39}=6.42 L  Finally, we can find the work done using the ideal gas law: W = nRT \ln(\frac{T_2}{T_1})-\frac{(P_2-P_1)V_2+(P_1V_1)}{2}  Since the pressure is constant, P1 = P2 = 87.39 Pa W = nRT \ln(\frac{T_2}{T_1})-\frac{(87.39*16.03+87.39*15.0)}{2}  = 2.0 * 8.3145 * ln(341/300) - 1386.7 = 1079.93 - 1386.7 = -306.77  Therefore, the work done w is approximately -306.777."
