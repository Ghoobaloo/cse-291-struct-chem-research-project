What is its final speed?assistant  **Formulae retrieval:** [Formula 1]: $E = e\Delta \phi$ (Energy acquired by the electron due to the electric field) [Formula 2]: $K = \frac{1}{2}mv^2$ (Kinetic energy equation) [Formula 3]: $E = K + U$ (Conservation of energy equation) where E is the total energy, K is the kinetic energy, U is the initial potential energy (which is zero since it starts at rest), m is the mass of the electron, v is the final velocity of the electron.  **Reasoning/calculation process:**  [Step 1]: Given that the electron's energy acquired from the potential difference is equal to $e\Delta \phi$, we can equate this to the kinetic energy of the electron using Formula 3: \[e\Delta \phi = \frac{1}{2}mv^2\]  [Step 2]: Since we know the charge of an electron ($e$) and the given potential difference $\Delta \phi$, we can substitute these values into the equation obtained from Step 1: \[e \times 10^5 \mathrm{V} = \frac{1}{2}m_{electron}v^2\]  [Step 3]: Now, we use the value of the electron's mass ($9.109 \times 10^{-31}\ \mathrm{kg}$) and solve for the velocity $v$: \[v^2 = \frac{2 \times e \times 10^5 \mathrm{V}}{m_{electron}}\] \[v^2 = \frac{2 \times 1.602 \times 10^{-19} \mathrm{C} \times 10^5 \mathrm{V}}{9.109 \times 10^{-31} \mathrm{kg}}\] \[v^2 = 3.508 \times 10^{15} \mathrm{m^2/s^2}\]  [Step 4]: Taking the square root of both sides gives us the final speed of the electron: \[v = \sqrt{3.508 \times 10^{15} \mathrm{m^2/s^2}}\] \[v = 1.877 \times 10^7 \mathrm{m/s}\]  **Answer conclusion:**  The answer is therefore \boxed{18770000}."

Calculate the energy gap in electronvolts between the valence and conduction bands.assistant  **Formulae retrieval:**  Planck's equation: E = hf  where h is Planck's constant and f is frequency. Speed of light equation: c = λf  where c is the speed of light and λ is wavelength. 1 eV = 1.602 * 10^-19 J   **Reasoning/calculation process:**  [step 1]: Convert the given wavelength from nm to m, since the speed of light is typically measured in m/s. 350 nm = 350 * 10^-9 m.  [step 2]: Use the speed of light equation to find the frequency at which the photon must have to promote the electron from the valence band to the conduction band. Rearrange the equation to isolate f, then substitute the values of c and λ. f = c / λ = (3*10^8 m/s) / (350 * 10^-9 m).  [step 3]: Now that we know the frequency, use Planck's equation to calculate the minimum energy required to excite the electron from the valence band to the conduction band. Substitute the values of h and f into the equation, noting that the value of h is 6.626 * 10^-34 J*s. E = hf = (6.626 * 10^-34 J*s) * ((3*10^8 m/s) / (350 * 10^-9 m)).  [step 4]: Since the question asks for the answer in electronvolts, convert the result from joules to electronvolts using the conversion factor. First, compute the energy in joules as per the calculation in step 3, then multiply by (1 eV) / (1.602 * 10^-19 J).   **Answer conclusion:** E = (6.626 * 10^-34 J*s) * ((3*10^8 m/s) / (350 * 10^-9 m)) * (1 eV)/(1.602 * 10^-19 J) ≈ 5.623 eV The answer is therefore \boxed{5.623}."

By how much does the standard molar enthalpy of $\mathrm{SO}_2(\mathrm{~g})$ increase when the temperature is raised from $298.15 \mathrm{~K}$ to $1500 \mathrm{~K}$?assistant  **Formulae retrieval:** Cp = ∂H/∂T (heat capacity at constant pressure is related to the change in enthalpy with respect to temperature) ΔH = ∫(Cp)dT (change in enthalpy can be calculated by integrating the heat capacity over the given temperature range) Cp = (8.314J/mol*K) + (21.9J/mol*K) + ((-18.7*10^(-6)) J/mol*K^2)* T + ((7.59 * 10^(-9)) J/mol*K^3)*(T^2) (sulfur dioxide heat capacity equation)  **Reasoning/calculation process:**  [Step 1]: First, we'll calculate the integral using the given heat capacity function and the limits of integration. We have the expression Cp = (8.314J/mol*K) + (21.9J/mol*K) + ((-18.7*10^(-6)) J/mol*K^2)* T + ((7.59 * 10^(-9)) J/mol*K^3)*(T^2).   [Step 2]: Since we're looking for ΔH, we integrate Cp with respect to T from 298.15 K to 1500 K. This means we need to evaluate the following expression:    ∫[(8.314+21.9 - (18.7*10^-6)T + (7.59*10^-9)T^2)dT] from 298.15 to 1500      [Step 3]: Now we perform the integration step by step:    ∫[8.314 dT] = [8.314*T]    ∫[21.9dT] = [21.9*T]    ∫[-(18.7*10^-6)TdT] = [-0.5*(18.7*10^-6)T^2]    ∫[(7.59*10^-9)T^2d T] = [(7.59*10^-9)/3]*T^3     [Step 4]: Apply the fundamental theorem of calculus to find the definite integrals between the given limits, i.e., from 298.15 K to 1500 K:    ΔH = [8.314*T] from 298.15 to 1500 + [21.9*T] from 298.15 to 1500 - [0.5*(18.7*10^-6)T^2] from 298.15 to 1500 + [(7.59*10^-9)/3]*T^3 from 298.15 to 1500  [Step 5]: Perform the calculation:    ΔH = [8.314*(1500-298.15)] + [21.9*(1500-298.15)] - [0.5*(18.7*10^-6)*(1500^2 - 298.15^2)] + [(7.59*10^-9)/3]*(1500^3-298.15^3)  [Step 6]: Simplify the above expression:    ΔH = [8.314*(1201.85)] + [21.9*(1201.85)] - [0.5*(18.7*10^-6)*(2250000 - 89045.5225)] + [(7.59*10^-9)/3]*(3375000000 - 24935112.75)  [Step 7]: Further simplification yields:    ΔH = 9983.231 + 26379.815 - [0.5*(18.7*10^-6)*(1359954.4775)] + [(7.59*10^-9)/3]*(32711487.2775)  [Step 8]: After further evaluation,    ΔH = 9983.231 + 26379.815 - [0.5*(18.7*10^-6)*(1359954.4775)] + [(7.59*10^-9)/3]*(32711487.2775)  [Step 9]: Calculate the remaining terms and sum them up:    ΔH = 9983.231 + 26379.815 - 761.419 + 87939.832  [Step 10]: Final addition gives us the result:    ΔH = 110142.559   **Answer conclusion:**  The answer is therefore \boxed{110143}."

At what temperature will the bottom of a column of mercury (density $13.6 \mathrm{~g} \mathrm{~cm}^{-3}$ ) of height $10.0 \mathrm{~m}$ be expected to freeze?assistant  **Formulae retrieval:**  $\Delta H_{\text {fusion }}=n R T_{f} \ln \left(\frac{V_{l}}{V_{s}}\right)$  $P = h \rho g$ $\Delta S_{\text {fusion }}=\frac{\Delta H_{\text {fusion }}}{T_{f}}$  **Reasoning/calculation process:**  [Step 1]: Given that $\Delta H_{\text {fusion }}=2.292 \mathrm{~kJ} \mathrm{~mol}^{-1}$, $T_{f}=234.3 \mathrm{~K}$, and $\Delta V=0.517 \mathrm{~cm}^{3} \mathrm{~mol}^{-1}$, we can use the equation $\Delta S_{\text {fusion }}=\frac{\Delta H_{\text {fusion }}}{T_{f}}$ to find the entropy change associated with the phase transition.  [Step 2]: Substituting the given values into the equation from step 1 yields: $\Delta S_{\text {fusion }}=\frac{(2.292 \mathrm{~kJ} \mathrm{~mol}^{-1})}{(234.3 \mathrm{~K})}=9.794 \times 10^{-3} \mathrm{~kJ} \mathrm{~K}^{-1} \mathrm{~mol}^{-1}$  [Step 3]: Rearranging the equation $\Delta H_{\text {fusion }}=n R T_{f} \ln \left(\frac{V_{l}}{V_{s}}\right)$ to isolate ln(V_l/V_s) gives us: $\ln \left(\frac{V_{l}}{V_{s}}\right)=\frac{\Delta H_{\text {fusion }}}{n R T_{f}}$  [Step 4]: Now substitute the known quantities into the rearranged equation from step 3. Note that R = 8.314 J K^-1 mol^-1.  $\ln \left(\frac{V_{l}}{V_{s}}\right)=\frac{(2.292 \times 10^{3} \mathrm{~J} \mathrm{~mol}^{-1})}{\left(8.314 \mathrm{~J} \mathrm{~K}^{-1} \mathrm{~mol}^{-1}\right)(234.3 \mathrm{~K})}=1.027$  [Step 5]: Taking the exponential of both sides gives us: $\frac{V_{l}}{V_{s}}=e^{1.027}=2.793$  [Step 6]: Since $\Delta V=V_{l}-V_{s}=0.517 \mathrm{~cm}^{3} \mathrm{~mol}^{-1}$, then $V_{l}=V_{s}+\Delta V$, so substituting these expressions into our result from step 5 yields: $\frac{V_{s}+\Delta V}{V_{s}}=2.793$  [Step 7]: Multiplying both sides of the equation by $V_{s}$ and simplifying gives us: $V_{s}+\Delta V=2.793 V_{s}$  [Step 8]: Rearrange to isolate $\Delta V$: $\Delta V=2.793 V_{s}-V_{s}=1.793 V_{s}$  [Step 9]: We now know that $\frac{\Delta V}{V_{s}}=1.793$. From the definition of the relative change in volume ($\frac{\Delta V}{V_{s}}$), we have: $\frac{\Delta V}{V_{s}}=\frac{n(RT_{f} \ln (\rho_{s} / \rho_{l}))}{h \rho_{l} g}$  [Step 10]: Substitute the value of $\frac{\Delta V}{V_{s}}$ into the equation from step 9 and rearrange it to get: $n=\frac{\left(h \rho_{l} g\right)}{\left(R T_{f} \ln \left(\rho_{s} / \rho_{l}\right)\right)}$  [Step 11]: Plug in the given values into the equation from step 10: $n=\frac{\left((10.0 \mathrm{~m})(13.6 \mathrm{~g} \mathrm{~cm}^{-3})(980 \mathrm{~cm} \mathrm{~s}^{-2})\right)}{\left((8.314 \mathrm{~J} \mathrm{~K}^{-1} \mathrm{~mol}^{-1})(234.3 \mathrm{~K}) \ln \left(13.6 \mathrm{~g} \mathrm{~cm}^{-3}/13.546 \mathrm{~g} \mathrm{~cm}^{-3}\right)\right)}=7.46 \times 10^{-6} \mathrm{~mol}$  [Step 12]: Next, we'll apply the Clausius-Clapeyron equation, which relates the slope of the melting curve of a substance to its entropy of fusion: $\frac{d P}{d T}=\frac{\Delta S_{\text {fusion }}}{T(V_{m}-b)}$  [Step 13]: Rearrange the equation from step 12 to solve for dT/dP: $\frac{d T}{d P}=\frac{T(V_{m}-b)}{\Delta S_{\text {fusion }}}$  [Step 14]: We can rewrite the expression for V_m as V_m = RT/P + b, and since density ρ = mass/mass, we can also write the volume V as m/ρ. Then V_m - b = (RT/P)/ρ + b - b = (RT/P)/ρ. Now, substitute this into the equation from step 13: $\frac{d T}{d P}=\frac{T\left(\frac{R T}{P \rho}\right)}{\Delta S_{\text {fusion }}}$  [Step 15]: Simplify the equation to express dT/dP in terms of known variables: $\frac{d T}{d P}=\frac{T R^{2} T}{P^{2} \rho \Delta S_{\text {fusion }}}$  [Step 16]: To determine at what pressure the mercury will freeze, we need to integrate dP along the vertical direction until we reach a height of 10 m: $h=-\int_{P_{i}}^{P_{f}} d T=-\int_{P_{i}}^{P_{f}} \frac{T R^{2} T}{P^{2} \rho \Delta S_{\text {fusion }}} d P$  [Step 17]: This integral doesn't have a straightforward analytical solution because of the presence of T in both the numerator and denominator. However, we can approximate the integral using numerical methods. But we can simplify it further assuming that the temperature remains constant over the integration interval. Let's assume the average temperature T_avg = (T_i + T_f)/2. If we make this assumption, we can write: $h \approx-T_{avg} R^{2} T_{avg} \int_{P_{i}}^{P_{f}} \frac{1}{P^{2} \rho \Delta S_{\text {fusion }}} d P$  [Step 18]: Now let's evaluate the integral: $h \approx-T_{avg} R^{2} T_{avg} \cdot\left[-\frac{1}{P \rho \Delta S_{\text {fusion }}}\right]_{P_{i}}^{P_{f}}$  [Step 19]: After evaluating the limits of integration and rearranging, we obtain the expression for the difference between the initial and final pressures: $P_{f}=P_{i} e^{-\left(-\frac{T_{avg} R^{2}}{h \rho \Delta S_{\text {fusion }}}\right)}$  [Step 20]: We know all of the necessary values except for the initial pressure $P_i$. By equating the potential energy of the mercury column to its weight, we can calculate the initial pressure: $U=mgh=(\rho V) gh=(\rho A h^{2} g) g$  [Step 21]: Therefore, $P_{i}=\rho g h=13600 \mathrm{~kg} \mathrm{~m}^{-3} \times 9.81 \mathrm{~m} \mathrm{~s}^{-2} \times 10000 \mathrm{~m}=133080000 \mathrm{~Pa}$  [Step 22]: Plugging in all of the values, including the calculated initial pressure $P_i$, into the equation from step 19 allows us to find the pressure at which the mercury will freeze: $P_{f}=133080000 \exp \left(-\left(\frac{(283.65 \mathrm{~K})(8.314 \mathrm{~J} \mathrm{~K}^{-1} \mathrm{~mol}^{-1})^{2}}{(10.0 \mathrm{~m})(13560 \mathrm{~kg} \mathrm{~m}^{-3})(9.81 \mathrm{~m} \mathrm{~s}^{-2})(9.794 \times 10^{-3} \mathrm{~kJ} \mathrm{~K}^{-1} \mathrm{~mol}^{-1})}\right)\right)$  [Step 23]: Evaluating the exponent and multiplying by the base of the natural"

Tobacco seed globulin forms face-centred cubic crystals with unit cell dimension of $12.3 \mathrm{~nm}$ and a density of $1.287 \mathrm{~g} \mathrm{~cm}^{-3}$. Determine its molar mass.assistant  **Formulae retrieval:** Avogadro's Number ($N_A$) = 6.022 x 10^23 mol^-1 Density Formula ($\rho$) = $\frac{\text { mass }}{\text { volume }}$ Unit Cell Volume Formula ($V$) = $a^3$  **Reasoning/calculation process:**  [Step 1]: To determine the volume of the unit cell, we can use the given unit cell dimension ($a=12.3 nm$). First, convert the length from nanometers to centimeters since the density is given in g/cm^3.   $a = 12.3 \times 10^{-7} cm$  [Step 2]: Now calculate the unit cell volume using the Unit Cell Volume Formula ($V=a^3$).  $V=(12.3 \times 10^{-7} cm)^3$  [Step 3]: Calculate the numerical value of the unit cell volume.  $V=1.703 \times 10^{-21} cm^{3}$  [Step 4]: Next, we'll use the Density Formula ($\rho=\frac{\text { mass }}{\text { volume }}$) to find the mass of the unit cell. Rearrange the formula to solve for mass.  $\text { Mass }=\rho V$  [Step 5]: Plug in the values for density ($\rho = 1.287 \, g / cm ^3$) and unit cell volume ($V=1.703 \times 10^{-21} cm ^{3}$) into the rearranged formula.  $\text { Mass }=(1.287 \, g / cm ^3)(1.703 \times 10^{-21} cm ^{3})$  [Step 6]: Perform the multiplication to get the mass of one unit cell.  $\text { Mass }=2.199 \times 10^{-21} \, g$  [Step 7]: Since Avogadro's Number ($N_A$) gives us the number of particles per mole, divide the mass of the unit cell by Avogadro's Number to obtain the molar mass.  $\text { Molar Mass }=\frac{\text { Mass of one unit cell }}{N_A}$  [Step 8]: Substitute the calculated mass of the unit cell and Avogadro's Number into the equation.  $\text { Molar Mass }=\frac{(2.199 \times 10^{-21} \, g)}{6.022 \times 10^{23} \, mol ^{-1}}$  [Step 9]: Simplify the expression to get the molar mass.  $\text { Molar Mass}=3.65 \times 10^{-23} \, g/mol$  However, it seems like we have obtained a very low molar mass due to incorrect calculations. Let's re-evaluate the calculation from Step 6.  [Revised Step 6]:  We know that the volume of a face-centered cubic (FCC) unit cell is $\frac{a^3}{4}$ because 1/8 of the atom at the center is shared by all six faces.  $V_{unitcell}=\frac{a^3}{4}$  Now let's substitute the value of $a$ into the revised volume formula and then proceed further.  [Revised Step 7]: $\frac{(12.3 \times 10^{-7})^3}{4}$  This results in: $V_{unitcell}=0.000298 \, cm^3$  Let's continue from here:  [Revised Step 8]: Mass of the unit cell = density * volume $mass_{unitcell}=1.287 \, g/cm^3*0.000298 \, cm^3$  This gives us: $mass_{unitcell}=0.383 \, g$  Now let's correct the rest of our previous steps:   [Revised Step 9]:  $\text { Molar Mass }=\frac{\text { Mass of one unit cell }}{N_A}$  Substituting the corrected values:  $\text { Molar Mass }=\frac{0.383 \, g}{6.022 \times 10^{23} \, mol ^{-1}}$  Simplifying, we get:  $\text { Molar Mass }=6.37 \times 10^{-22} \, g/mol$  However, considering the nature of the question, a more logical approach would be to consider the number of atoms present within the FCC unit cell of tobacco seed globulin.   A face-centered cubic lattice has four atoms per unit cell. Therefore, we must multiply the mass of the unit cell by 4 to get the total mass for 4 atoms.   $mass_{4atoms}=0.383 \times 4$  This gives us: $mass_{4atoms}=1.532 \, g$  [Final Step 10]: $\text { Molar Mass }=\frac{\text { Mass of 4 atoms }}{N_A}$   Substitute the corrected values:  $\text { Molar Mass }=\frac{1.532 \, g}{6.022 \times 10^{23} \, mol ^{-1}}$  Simplify to get the molar mass:   $\text { Molar Mass }=2.54 \times 10^{-22} \times 4$  $\text { Molar Mass }=1.016 \times 10^{-21} \, g/mol \times 1000$  $\text { Molar Mass }=1.016 \times 10^{-18} \, g/mol \times 1000$  $\text { Molar Mass }=1.016 \, g/mol \times 1000$  Since we cannot have a molar mass of $1.016\times 1000$, the calculation was done incorrectly again.

As a result of the reaction, a piston is pushed out through $15 \mathrm{~cm}$ against an external pressure of $1.0 \mathrm{~atm}$. Calculate the work done by the system.assistant  **Formulae retrieval:**  Pascal's law can be used here. However, we also need the formula for work done, which is given by $W=P\Delta V$ where W is the work done, P is the pressure, and $\Delta V$ is the change in volume.  We will use Boyle's Law ($PV = nRT$) to find the initial volume of gas inside the container and subsequently calculate the work done using the formula $W = P\Delta V$.  However, since it's an adiabatic process involving gas expansion against an external pressure, we'll assume ideal gas behavior for our calculation. We can derive the relationship between pressure and volume from Boyle's law but since it involves temperature, we must convert the work equation into one that involves only pressure and volume.  Firstly, let's simplify the work equation. We can write it as $dW = -PdV$, where dW is the infinitesimal work done and dV is the infinitesimal volume change.   Since the process is quasi-static and reversible, we integrate both sides to get the total work done.  **Reasoning/calculation process:**  [Step 1]:  To start with, we need to express the pressure of the external force in pascals and then apply the formula $P = \frac{F}{A}$ to find the pressure exerted by the piston due to the external force.  The pressure of the external force can be calculated by converting 1 atm to Pascals: $1 \mathrm{~atm} = 101325 \mathrm{Pa}$.  Then the pressure exerted by the piston is $P_{piston} = \frac{F}{A} = \frac{P_{external}}{g_{c}}$, where $g_c$ is the gravitational constant, however in this case we have been provided with Area so it simplifies to just F/A or Pressure times Area.  Thus, $F= PA$  Now let's calculate the force acting on the piston due to the external pressure: $F = PA = (101325)(50)$  [Step 2]: Next, we need to determine the initial volume of the gas before the reaction occurred. Since we're dealing with an ideal gas, we'll use the ideal gas equation $PV=nRT$. However, since we don't know the amount of substance 'n', we can rearrange the equation to isolate V.  Rearranging the ideal gas equation to isolate V gives us $V=\frac{nRT}{P}$.  However, because we want to find the change in volume ($\Delta V$), we'll denote the initial volume as $V_1$ and the final volume as $V_2$. Thus, we'll calculate $\Delta V = V_2-V_1$.  Let's assume the initial volume was $V_1 = \frac{nRT_1}{P_1}$ and the final volume is $V_2 = \frac{nRT_2}{P_2}$  Given that the temperature remains constant during the process, $T_1=T_2$, the equation reduces to $\Delta V = \frac{nR(T_2-T_1)}{P_2}$, but as previously mentioned T1 = T2.  However, in this scenario we actually know the displacement of the piston which implies the volume has increased by the amount equal to the area times the displacement i.e., $\Delta V = A\delta x = 50 * 0.15$  [Step 3]: Now that we have $\Delta V$, we can substitute it back into the equation for work done, $W=P\Delta V$. The pressure P is the pressure exerted by the piston due to the external force, so $P=F/A = (101325*50)/50 = 101325$. Substituting these values, we get $W=(101325)(0.15)$  [Step 4]: Perform the multiplication to obtain the numerical value of work done.  **Answer conclusion:**  The answer is therefore $\boxed{15198.75}$."

Given that the mass of ethanol is $35 \mathrm{~g}$ and its mass density is $0.789 \mathrm{~g} \mathrm{~cm}^{-3}$. $\rho = 0.789 \mathrm{~g} \mathrm{~cm}^{-3}$ $m = 35 \mathrm{~g}$ $V = \frac{m}{\rho} = \frac{35 \mathrm{~g}}{0.789 \mathrm{~g} \mathrm{~cm}^{-3}}$  [Step 2]: Convert the given pressures to Pascals: To use the formula $\Delta G = -nRT \ln\left(\frac{P_2}{P_1}\right)$, we need to convert the given pressures from atmospheres to Pascals because R is defined in terms of Pascals. $1 \text{atm} = 101325 \text{Pa}$ Therefore, $P_{1} = 1 \times 101325 \text{ Pa} = 101325 \text{ Pa}$ $P_{2} = 3000 \times 101325 \text{ Pa} = 303975000 \text{ Pa}$  [Step 3]: Calculate the change in Gibbs free energy: Now we can substitute the values into the equation $\Delta G = -nRT \ln\left(\frac{P_2}{P_1}\right)$.  Since we don't know the number of moles, we'll express the calculation in terms of molar gas constant ($R$). $nRT$ will then become the product of the gas constant ($R$), temperature ($T$), and the amount of substance ($n$). However, since it's expressed as $n$, we still lack information about it. In reality, the actual value would depend upon the molecular weight of the compound and the given mass. We assume the molar mass of ethanol is approximately $46.07 \, g/mol$. Let us consider one mole of ethanol. So, $n=1$. Using the ideal gas law, $PV=nRT$. Rearranging it to isolate n gives us $n=\frac{PV}{RT}$, thus the expression becomes $\Delta G=-\frac{PV}{RT} RT \ln{\frac{P_2}{P_1}} = -P V \ln{\frac{P_2}{P_1}}$  Substituting the calculated volume, $V = \frac{35 \mathrm{~g}}{0.789 \mathrm{~g} \mathrm{~cm}^{-3}} = 44.42 \mathrm{~cm^3}$  and the converted pressures, $\Delta G = -(303975000 \text{ Pa})(44.42 \times 10^{-6} \text{ m}^3)(\ln(303975000/101325))$  [Step 4]: Substitute numerical values for constants. The molar gas constant $R=8.3145 \, J/(mol*K)$ and assume room temperature $T=298 K$. However, we previously considered $n=1$ mol. Since our previous equation was expressed in terms of one mole, let us just proceed with the same assumption and keep in mind that the result might not be accurate due to missing data.   Thus, $\Delta G = -(303975000 \text{ Pa})(44.42 \times 10^{-6} \text{ m}^3)(\ln(303975000/101325))$ $\Delta G = -1347.41J$  **Answer conclusion:** $\boxed{-1347.41}$"

Calculate the difference in glancing angles $(2 \theta)$ of the diffraction lines arising from the two components in a diffraction pattern from planes of separation $77.8 \mathrm{pm}$.assistant  **Formulae retrieval:**  Bragg's Law: $n\lambda = 2d \sin(\theta)$, where $\lambda$ is the wavelength, d is the spacing between planes, and $\theta$ is the angle of incidence.  Sine addition formula: $\sin(A-B) = \sin A \cos B - \cos A \sin B$  **Reasoning/calculation process:**  [Step 1]: First, we apply Bragg's Law to find the angle of incidence ($\theta$) for both wavelengths. Let's denote $\theta_1$ and $\theta_2$ as the angles of incidence for the two wavelengths.  $\lambda_1 = 154.433 \mathrm{pm}, \quad \lambda_2 = 154.051 \mathrm{pm}, \quad d = 77.8 \mathrm{pm}$  We can rearrange Bragg's Law to solve for $\sin(\theta) = \frac{n\lambda}{2d}$, since we're given that n=1 for the first order diffraction.  For $\lambda_1$:  $$ \sin(\theta_1)= \frac{\lambda_1}{2d}=\frac{154.433}{2*77.8}=0.9946 $$  For $\lambda_2$:  $$ \sin(\theta_2)= \frac{\lambda_2}{2d}=\frac{154.051}{2*77.8}=0.9935 $$  [Step 2]: Now that we have the sines of the angles, let's calculate the angles themselves using the arcsin function.  $$ \theta_1 = \arcsin(0.9946), \quad \theta_2 = \arcsin(0.9935) $$  Using a calculator: $$ \theta_1 \approx 83.43^\circ, \quad \theta_2 \approx 82.99^\circ $$  [Step 3]: Next, we want to find the glancing angles (2θ). To find the difference between these angles, we'll use the sine subtraction formula to find $\sin(2\theta_1-2\theta_2)$.  First, we need to convert the angles to radians for consistency: $$ 2\theta_1 = 2 * 83.43^\circ = 166.86^\circ, \quad 2\theta_2 = 2 * 82.99^\circ = 165.98^\circ $$  Now we convert to radians: $$ 2\theta_1 = 2.91 \text{ rad}, \quad 2\theta_2 = 2.89 \text{ rad} $$  Then, $$ \sin(2\theta_1-2\theta_2) = \sin(2.91-2.89) = \sin(0.02) \approx 0.0201 $$  However, to get the actual difference in glancing angles, we need to multiply this result by 2 because we're looking at twice the angles.  [Step 4]: Therefore, we multiply by 2 to obtain the actual difference: $$ 2*\sin(2\theta_1-2\theta_2) \approx 2 * 0.0201 \approx 0.0402 \text{ rad} $$  Since the question asks for the answer in degrees and the calculation has been performed in radians, we must convert back to degrees: $$ 0.0402 \text{ rad} * \frac{180^\circ}{\pi} \approx 2.31^\circ $$  **Answer conclusion:** The answer is therefore \boxed{2.310}."

If a small change in the mixture composition results in an increase in the chemical potential of water by $0.25 \mathrm{~J} \mathrm{~mol}^{-1}$, by how much will the chemical potential of ethanol change?assistant  **Formulae retrieval:** $\mu_{i}=\mu_{i}^{*}(T,P)+RT\ln(x_{i})$   (Chemical potential of component i in a mixture) $\mu_{i}^{*}$ = Chemical potential of pure component i at temperature T and pressure P R = Gas constant x_i = Mole fraction of component i  **Reasoning/calculation process:**  Since we know that the initial mole fraction of water is 0.60, let's denote it as x_1 = 0.60. Let's assume the initial chemical potential of water is μ_1. Also, let's denote the initial chemical potential of ethanol as μ_2.  Given that a small change in the mixture composition results in an increase in the chemical potential of water by $0.25 \mathrm{~J} \mathrm{~mol}^{-1}$, we can write: Δμ_1 = 0.25 J mol^-1  Using the formula for chemical potential, we can express Δμ_1 as: Δμ_1 = RT ln(x_1') - RT ln(x_1)  where x_1' is the new mole fraction of water.  We are given that Δμ_1 = 0.25 J mol^-1. Since the temperature and pressure remain unchanged, R remains constant. Therefore, we can rewrite the equation as: 0.25 = RT ln(x_1'/x_1)  Now, since x_1 = 0.60, we can substitute this value into the above equation to get: 0.25 = RT ln(x_1'/0.60)  Let's use the fact that the sum of mole fractions of all components in a mixture equals 1: x_1' + x_2' = 1  Since x_1 = 0.60, we have x_2' = 1 - x_1' = 1 - 0.60 = 0.40  Substituting x_2' = 0.40 into the previous equation gives us: 0.25 = RT ln(0.40/0.60)  Simplifying further: 0.25 = RT ln(2/3)  Now, let's consider the change in the chemical potential of ethanol, Δμ_2. Using the same formula for chemical potential, we can express Δμ_2 as: Δμ_2 = RT ln(x_2') - RT ln(x_2)  Substituting x_2' = 0.40 and x_2 = 1 - x_1 = 1 - 0.60 = 0.40 into the above equation, we get: Δμ_2 = RT ln(0.40) - RT ln(0.40)  Δμ_2 = RT [ln(0.40) - ln(0.40)]  However, since ln(a) - ln(b) = ln(a/b), the above expression simplifies to: Δμ_2 = RT ln(0.40 / 0.40)  Δμ_2 = RT * ln(1)  Since ln(1) = 0, we can conclude that: Δμ_2 = 0   **Answer conclusion:** The answer is therefore $\boxed{0.000}$."
