What is its work function?assistant  **Formulae retrieval:**  We can use Einstein's photoelectric equation to find the work function:  \[E_{\mathrm{photon}} = hf = \frac{hc}{\lambda}\]  where: - \(E_{\mathrm{photon}}\) is the energy of the photon, - \(h\) is Planck's constant ($6.626 \times 10^{-34} \mathrm{J \cdot s}$), - \(c\) is the speed of light ($3.00 \times 10^8 \mathrm{m/s}$), - $\lambda$ is the wavelength of the radiation.  We also know that the work function is given by the formula:  \[W = hf - E_{\mathrm{kinetic\ maximum}}\]  However, since we're only interested in the work function, we don't actually need to calculate the kinetic energy of the electrons. We can directly equate the work function to the photon energy.  **Reasoning/calculation process:**  Step 1: Rearrange Einstein's photoelectric equation to isolate the work function term.  \[\frac{hc}{\lambda} = W + \frac{1}{2}mv^2\]  Since we're looking for the work function, let's consider the case where the kinetic energy of the electron is zero. In this case, the equation simplifies to:  \[W = \frac{hc}{\lambda}\]  Step 2: Plug in the values for Planck's constant (\(h\)), the speed of light (\(c\)), and the wavelength of the radiation ($\lambda$).  \[W = \frac{(6.626 \times 10^{-34}) \times (3.00 \times 10^8)}{564 \times 10^{-9}}\]  Step 3: Perform the calculation to obtain the work function.  \[W = \frac{19.878 \times 10^{-26}}{564 \times 10^{-9}}\] \[W = 35.16 \times 10^{-17}\] \[W = 3.516 \times 10^{-15}\]  **Answer conclusion:**  The answer is therefore \boxed{3.516}."

This is given by p = h / λ. Substituting the value of λ into the equation, we get p = h / (1.0 × 10^(-10) ).  Step 2: Next, using the formula p = √(2 m E ), we can substitute the expression for p from step 1 into the equation. This gives us √(2 m E ) = h / (1.0 × 10^(-10) ).  Step 3: To eliminate the square root, we square both sides of the equation, giving us 2 m E = (h / (1.0 × 10^(-10) ))^2.  Step 4: We know that the mass of a proton is approximately equal to 1.67 × 10^(-27) kg. Substituting this value into the equation, we have 2 × 1.67 × 10^(-27) E = (h / (1.0 × 10^(-10) ))^2.  Step 5: Rearranging the equation to isolate E, we get E = ((h / (1.0 × 10^(-10) ))^2 ) / (2 × 1.67 × 10^(-27) ). Plugging in the value of Planck's constant (h = 6.626 × 10^(-34) ), we calculate E = ((6.626 × 10^(-34) / (1.0 × 10^(-10) ))^2 ) / (2 × 1.67 × 10^(-27) ).  Step 6: Evaluating the expression, we obtain E ≈ ((6.626 × 10^24 ) / (2 × 1.67 × 10^(-17) ).  Step 7: Simplifying further, we get E ≈ 1.99 × 10^41 J.  **Answer conclusion:**  The answer is therefore 1.990 × 10^41."

Particles that last for time $\Delta t$ or more are called real particles; particles that last less than time $\Delta t$ are called virtual particles. The mass of the charged pion, a subatomic particle, is $2.5 \times 10^{-28} \mathrm{~kg}$. What is the minimum lifetime if the pion is to be considered a real particle?assistant  **Formulae retrieval:** E=mc² h = 6.626 × 10^-34 J s mc² = 9.11 × 10^-31 kg m²/s²   **Reasoning/calculation process:**  Step 1: Calculate the value of the energy-momentum product E·c² using the given mass of the pion. Given that the mass of the charged pion is 2.5 × 10^-28 kg, we have: E·c² = mc² = 2.5 × 10^-28 kg × (9.11 × 10^16 m/s)²  Step 2: Evaluate the expression to obtain the numerical value of E·c². E·c² = 2.5 × 10^-28 kg × (9.11 × 10^16 m/s)² = 2.25625 × 10^-11 J   Step 3: Set up the equation Δt ≤ hc/E·c² to represent the condition under which a particle is considered real. Δt ≤ (6.626 × 10^-34 J s)/ (2.25625 × 10^-11 J)   Step 4: Solve the inequality to find the minimum lifetime Δt. Δt ≥ 2.9229 × 10^-23 s  **Answer conclusion:** 0.923 × 10^-23"
