Particles that last for time $\Delta t$ or more are called real particles; particles that last less than time $\Delta t$ are called virtual particles. The mass of the charged pion, a subatomic particle, is $2.5 \times 10^{-28} \mathrm{~kg}$. What is the minimum lifetime if the pion is to be considered a real particle?assistant  **Formulae retrieval:**  E = mc^2 (relating energy and mass)   h = Planck's constant    **Reasoning/calculation process:**  [Step 1]: First, we need to rearrange E = mc^2 to find c^2 in terms of m.  c^2 = E/m   [Step 2]: Now substitute the given value of m into the expression found in Step 1 to get the square of speed of light.  First, calculate the square of speed of light: c^2 = (6.626 * 10^-34 J*s)/(2.5 * 10^-28 kg) = 2.6512 * 10^14 m^2/s^2  [Step 3]: Take the square root of both sides of the equation to find the value of c.  Now take the square root of c^2: c = sqrt(2.6512 * 10^14 m^2/s^2) = 5.15 * 10^7 m/s  [Step 4]: Use the given equation Δt ≤ h / mc^2 and replace h with its value.  Δt ≤ (6.626 * 10^-34 J*s)/((2.5 * 10^-28 kg)*(5.15*10^7 m/s)^2)  [Step 5]: Simplify the above expression. Calculate the denominator first: (2.5 * 10^-28 kg)*(5.15*10^7 m/s)^2 = (2.5 * 10^-28 kg)* (2.652225 * 10^16 m^2/s^2) = 6.63305625 * 10^-12 kg*m^2/s^2 Then simplify the fraction: (6.626 * 10^-34 J*s)/ (6.63305625 * 10^-12 kg*m^2/s^2) = 9.98635544 * 10^-23 s  [Step 6]: Since the problem asks for the minimum lifetime for the pion to be considered a real particle, the inequality becomes an equality because we want the smallest possible value of Δt. Therefore, Δt = 9.98635544 * 10^-23 s  **Answer conclusion:**  9.986 The answer is therefore \boxed{0.009986}."

What is its work function?assistant  **Formulae retrieval:** Einstein's photoelectric equation: $K_{max} = h\nu - W$ Planck-Einstein equation relating energy of photon and wavelength: $\nu = \frac{c}{\lambda}$   **Reasoning/calculation process:**  Given that we know the threshold wavelength ($\lambda$) and speed of light ($c$), we can calculate the frequency ($\nu$) using Planck-Einstein equation: $\nu = \frac{c}{\lambda}$  Firstly, substitute the given values into the Planck-Einstein equation: $\nu = \frac{3.00 \times 10^8 m/s}{564 \times 10^{-9} m}$  Then perform the division to obtain the value of $\nu$:  $\nu = \frac{3.00 \times 10^8 m/s}{564 \times 10^{-9} m} = 5.32 \times 10^{14} s^{-1}$  Next, use Einstein's photoelectric equation to find the work function ($W$): $W = h\nu - K_{max}$  However, since the question does not mention anything about $K_{max}$, it must be referring to the minimum energy required to eject electrons from the surface of the potassium metal when no light is incident, i.e., the work function itself. In other words, at threshold wavelength, $K_{max}$ equals zero because all the energy goes towards overcoming the work function. Thus, the equation becomes:  $W = h\nu$  Now, plug in the value of $\nu$ calculated earlier into this equation to get the work function: $W = (6.626 \times 10^{-34} J s)(5.32 \times 10^{14} s^{-1})$  Perform the multiplication to calculate the work function: $W = 35.24 \times 10^{-20} J$  Finally, convert the work function into Joules to three significant figures: $W = 3.52 \times 10^{-19} J$  **Answer conclusion:** 3.52 x 10^-19 The answer is therefore \boxed{3.52 x 10^-19}."

[step 2]: Since it's an infinite geometric progression, we use the sum formula S = a / (1 - r), where a is the first term and r is the common ratio.

Find the original energy level of the electron.assistant  **Formulae retrieval:**  Rydberg's Formula:  $\frac{1}{\lambda}=R_H Z^2 \left(\frac{1}{n_f^2}-\frac{1}{n_i^2}\right)$  where $\lambda$ is the wavelength of the emitted light, R$_H$ is Rydberg's constant ($1.097 \times 10^7 \, \mathrm{m}^{-1}$), Z is the atomic number, and n$_i$ and n$_f$ are the initial and final principal quantum numbers of the electron.  **Reasoning/calculation process:**  [Step 1]: Given that the given line belongs to the Lyman series, we know that it involves transitions from a higher energy level (n$_i$) to the ground state (n$_f$ = 1). Therefore, the equation can be simplified to: $\frac{1}{\lambda}=R_H Z^2 \left(\frac{1}{1^2}-\frac{1}{n_i^2}\right)=R_H Z^2\left(1-\frac{1}{n_i^2}\right)$  [Step 2]: We are also given that Z = 1 for hydrogen. So, $\frac{1}{\lambda}=R_H \left(1-\frac{1}{n_i^2}\right)$  [Step 3]: Substitute the values of R$_H$ and $\lambda$ into the above equation: $\frac{1}{1.03\times 10^{-7}}=1.097\times 10^{7}\left(1-\frac{1}{n_i^2}\right)$  [Step 4]: Simplify the equation: $9.66\times 10^{6}=1.097\times 10^{7}\left(1-\frac{1}{n_i^2}\right)$  [Step 5]: Divide both sides by 1.097 $\times 10^{7}$: $\frac{9.66\times 10^{6}}{1.097\times 10^{7}}=\left(1-\frac{1}{n_i^2}\right)$  [Step 6]: Solve for $\left(1-\frac{1}{n_i^2}\right)$: $0.880=\left(1-\frac{1}{n_i^2}\right)$  [Step 7]: Rearrange the equation to isolate $\frac{1}{n_i^2}$: $\frac{1}{n_i^2}=1-0.88$  [Step 8]: Simplify the right-hand side: $\frac{1}{n_i^2}=0.12$  [Step 9]: Take the reciprocal of both sides: $n_i^2 = \frac{1}{0.12}$  [Step 10]: Calculate the value: $n_i^2=8.333...$  [Step 11]: Since $n_i$ must be an integer, take the square root of both sides: $n_i = \sqrt{8.333...}$  [Step 12]: Evaluate the square root: $n_i=2.877...$  **Answer conclusion:** The answer is therefore $\boxed{2.877}.$"

Since the leading term in the expansion of (1 - e^(-βx))^2 is (1 - 2 + β^2x^2), the leading terms of the Morse potential near equilibrium position are given by: V(x) ≈ D(1 - 2 + β^2x^2) = -D + β^2 Dx^2.  Comparing this expression with Hooke's law, we see that the force constant k is given by: k = d^2V/dx^2 = 2Dβ^2.  [Step 2]: Plug in the values of D and β into the expression for k. k = 2 × (7.31 × 10^-19 J/molecule) × (1.81 × 10^10 m^-1)^2   First, we multiply the numbers inside the parentheses: (1.81 × 10^10)^2 = 3.2721 × 10^20  Now multiply the result by 2 and then by 7.31 × 10^-19: k = 2 × 7.31 × 10^-19 × 3.2721 × 10^20 = 478.15142 × 10^1  Finally, simplify the exponent: k = 4781.5142  Round the value to three decimal places: k = 4781.514  **Answer conclusion:**  The answer is therefore \boxed{4781.514}."

[Step 2] Using Formula 2, we find that the first term a_1 = 1 / 3^0 = 1.  [Step 3] Now, using Formula 3, we can calculate the sum S of the infinite geometric series. Plugging in a_1 = 1 and r = 1/3 into the equation S = a_1 / (1 - r), we get S = 1 / (1 - 1/3).  [Step 4] Simplifying the denominator, we have S = 1 / (2/3).  [Step 5] To simplify the fraction, we can multiply both the numerator and the denominator by 3 to eliminate the fraction in the denominator. This gives us S = 3 / 2.

Rest mass-energy equivalence: $E_{\text{rest}} = mc^2$ 4. Momentum equation: $p = mv$  However, since the given kinetic energy is only $100 \mathrm{eV}$, we can assume that the non-relativistic approximation holds, so we'll use: 5. Non-relativistic kinetic energy equation: $K = \frac{1}{2}mv^2$  **Reasoning/calculation process:**  [Step 1]: First, convert the kinetic energy from eV to Joules:  Since $1 \mathrm{eV} = 1.602 \times 10^{-19} \mathrm{J}$, $100 \mathrm{eV} = 100 \cdot 1.602 \times 10^{-19} \mathrm{J} = 1.602 \times 10^{-17} \mathrm{J}$  [Step 2]: Use the non-relativistic kinetic energy equation to find the velocity of the electron: $\frac{1}{2}mv^2 = K$, thus $v^2 = \frac{2K}{m}$. Since the mass of an electron is approximately $9.109 \times 10^{-31} \mathrm{kg}$, we have $v^2 = \frac{2(1.602 \times 10^{-17})}{9.109 \times 10^{-31}}$.  [Step 3]: Solve for v: $v^2 = \frac{2(1.602 \times 10^{-17})}{9.109 \times 10^{-31}} = 3.52 \times 10^{13} \mathrm{m^2/s^2}$, so $v = \sqrt{3.52 \times 10^{13}} \mathrm{m/s}$.  [Step 4]: Calculate the momentum using the momentum equation: $p = mv = (9.109 \times 10^{-31})(\sqrt{3.52 \times 10^{13}})$.  [Step 5]: Evaluate the expression inside the square root: $\sqrt{3.52 \times 10^{13}} \approx 1.88 \times 10^{6}$.  [Step 6]: Now calculate the momentum: $p = (9.109 \times 10^{-31})(1.88 \times 10^{6}) = 1.71642 \times 10^{-24} \mathrm{kg m/s}$.  [Step 7]: Plug in the value of Planck's constant ($h=6.626 \times 10^{-34} \mathrm{J s}$) into the de Broglie wavelength equation: $\lambda = \frac{h}{p} = \frac{6.626 \times 10^{-34}}{1.71642 \times 10^{-24}}$.  [Step 8]: Simplify the fraction: $\lambda \approx \frac{6.626 \times 10^{-34}}{1.71642 \times 10^{-24}} = 3.857 \times 10^{-10} \mathrm{m}$.  **Answer conclusion:**  The answer is therefore $\boxed{3.857}$."
